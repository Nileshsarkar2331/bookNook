👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Nilesh Sarkar, a B.Tech 3rd year student currently pursuing my degree from Lloyd Institute of Engineering and Technology. I’m passionate about web development, especially building modern, responsive, and user-focused applications. I enjoy working with technologies like React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and modern UI libraries, and I’m constantly learning new tools to improve my development skills. I love turning ideas into real-world projects and believe in writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
